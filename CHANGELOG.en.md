# Changelog · Keyflow

> **Bản tiếng Việt: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** · This is the English edition of the same document. The
> two files carry the same content and **the same list of versions**; `tools/check_sources.py`
> (`scan_release_version`) compares that list in both against `<Version>` in `PianoPath.csproj`, so neither
> edition can drift from the other and a new entry cannot sit in the repository without being in a release.

Everything a user can see is recorded here, following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

The version number is written down in **one** place in the code — `<Version>` in `PianoPath.csproj` — and the
application reads it back through `AppInfo.Version` (the start-up menu's version label, the About box, the
`--bench` report). The copies that cannot read an assembly at run time (the fallback in
`installer\Keyflow.iss`, the `git tag` and `/DAppVersion=` examples in both READMEs, the newest entry of both
of these files) are pinned to the same number by `scan_release_version`: forgetting one turns the static
check red instead of shipping a release that states two versions.

The product's technical limits live in the README's *[Current limitations](README.en.md#current-limitations)*
section and are not repeated here; the open work lives in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-03

The first official release. Keyflow is a Windows desktop application (C# · WPF · .NET 10) to **play, practise
and make piano videos from MIDI** at concert-performance quality, with an interface in **English and Tiếng
Việt** that switches while the application runs. The whole v0.5–v0.8 scope of `docs/ROADMAP.md` has landed;
this entry describes the product as released rather than listing every commit (no release was cut before
1.0.0, so the detailed history is the commit log and the pull requests).

### Stage & graphics

- A **Direct3D 11 GPU engine** (Vortice) draws the stage on its own thread: 16-bit HDR, multi-layer bloom, a
  frame target of 60/120/144/240 FPS or unlimited, and it never blocks MIDI input. The HLSL shaders are
  embedded in the assembly and compiled at start-up with the `d3dcompiler_47.dll` Windows already ships.
- 88-key keyboard shading after the Unreal model: Cook-Torrance GGX + softbox + ACES filmic tone mapping;
  sparks that cool by thermal radiation, acoustic resonance waves, fire at the strike point, acoustic dust,
  petals and stage lights — each layer switchable on its own.
- The **WPF renderer** (multi-threaded CPU shaders) is the fallback when Direct3D will not start, and the
  path the transparent PNG recording draws on; the General page says which engine is running and why.
- **14 built-in presets** and **3 community presets** embedded in the assembly (`presets/*.json`); user
  presets keep a thumbnail the stage rendered itself; a **look-sharing code** `KEYFLOW-LOOK-1:…` (gzip JSON in
  base64url) carries a look to another machine, drops the background-image path and re-`Clamp()`s on decode.
- Three interface themes (Concert Grand, Concert Noir, Velvet Gold) plus a user **theme studio**: five base
  colours derive twenty tokens, stored in `<settings>/themes/*.json`; Windows high contrast is detected and
  repainted the moment the system changes.

### Audio

- A hand-written **SoundFont 2** synthesizer with no extra dependency: presets/zones/samples, generator
  semantics (instrument overrides, preset accumulation), loops, the release stage, a polyphony limit and
  sustain/sostenuto/soft.
- The bundled SoundFont: FreePats' **YDP Grand Piano** (Yamaha Disklavier Pro multisamples), licensed
  **CC BY 3.0**, ~113 MiB through Git LFS; `Assets/ATTRIBUTION.txt` carries the credit and ships in every
  package.
- `waveOut` output; a machine that cannot open an audio device still runs everything else and says exactly
  why.

### Import & sheet music

- **MIDI** format 0/1/2, both time-division kinds (PPQ and SMPTE), tempo maps, the percussion channel, track
  names, a beat grid grouped per measure (`Meter.Of`: 4/4, 3/4, 2/2, 3/8 count the written unit; 6/8, 9/8,
  12/8 count groups of three; 7/8 still counts seven), and corrupt files are refused.
- **MusicXML** `.musicxml`/`.xml`/`.mxl` (compressed read through `META-INF/container.xml`), a cursor kept per
  part/measure against `divisions`, `backup`/`forward`, tempo changes mid-piece, chords sharing one onset, and
  a hand-split point read from `<staff>`.
- A **sheet-music layer** drawn on the stage: the piece's key signature inferred (Krumhansl–Kessler
  correlation), accidentals spelled per measure, short notes beamed to the beat, rests written for the silent
  hand, ties across a barline, chords merged into one stemmed column, a slur where the line changes hands,
  and ledger lines only when a note leaves the staff.
- **Hand-split inference** from the piece itself: two clusters by sounding duration, accepted only with ≥5
  semitones of gap between the hands and ≥10% of the duration each, preferring the note nearest C4; a
  one-handed or overlapping piece keeps the user's choice, and the result is remembered per song.

### Practice

- Note-by-note scoring (hits/misses, accuracy, longest streak) that **keeps every graded note** of a run (up
  to 256) so the dock can draw a **ghost**: the best run above, the latest below.
- A **14-day chart** grouped by local day (a day without practice is still a zero row), in the dock and in the
  HTML report.
- **Automatic practice tempo**: more misses in a row than the threshold (1–6, default 3) steps down 5% to a
  floor of 50%, four correct notes in a row step up 2% and stop at 100% — every step goes through the tempo
  slider itself.
- **Practice history** appends one JSON line per run to `history/practice.jsonl` (the latest 200 runs, corrupt
  lines skipped); the **History** page prints the recent runs and the best run of the open song, with
  **EXPORT HTML** and **CLEAR HISTORY**.

### Recording

- **MP4 (H.264 + AAC)** written directly by the Media Foundation sink writer Windows already ships, with the
  audio inside the file: the stage's BGRA frames converted to NV12, a bitrate from size × fps, and the audio
  engine's PCM encoded to AAC through the shared `IAudioTrack` contract.
- **AVI** (MJPEG, or uncompressed RGB when the machine has no codec; 2 GB ceiling) with the audio in a
  16-bit stereo **WAV** beside it, plus the ffmpeg command line to mux the two.
- A **32-bit PNG sequence with alpha** for transparent-background post work, with `sequence.json` and the
  `libvpx-vp9` + `yuva420p` ffmpeg line that rebuilds it into an alpha WebM.
- Encoding runs in a **child process** (`--encode-take`) with a codec probe before the take and a plumbing
  probe when the take produced no file, so a codec that takes the process down still leaves the verdict; the
  recorder's open window is wrapped in a 10-second `HangGuard` and **falls back to AVI** with a message on a
  machine whose media stack hangs.
- A **camera overlay** (a live camera or a looping video file, placed by corner, mirrored, opacity, green
  key) and **hand tracking** with classical vision: a YCbCr skin-colour rule with its own sensitivity, a
  32×24 grid, a finger count from the column profile, and a lit band on the key the hand is over.
- **No more freezes and no more broken files when recording** — three fixes after the first cut: every frame
  and audio block releases its Media Foundation COM buffer in a `finally` (they used to wait for the GC, so
  memory ballooned and the window froze when they were all freed at once); frames and audio go through a
  bounded queue to a worker thread that does the NV12 conversion and the encoder write, and frames the
  encoder falls behind on are folded into the newest one as repeats so the file keeps real time; a whole MP4
  take lives on **one thread** (Media Foundation refuses a sink writer created on one thread and called from
  another, which is why earlier takes came out empty or without an index) and a failed close is reported
  instead of ignored; AVI is written off the UI thread too, repeats are written as zero-byte null frames
  rather than re-compressed duplicates, and a take is capped at **1080p** in both directions.
- **MP4 is now the default format**, and the file it writes opens in every player: `MF_MT_FRAME_SIZE` packs
  the width into the high word, but the recorder passed the height first, so the encoder read every frame
  with the wrong stride and a 1920×1080 take was declared 1080×1920 — horizontal static on screen. The size
  is now declared as width × height, `--soak-record` compares the size the file declares with the size that
  was asked for, and new profiles default to MP4 instead of AVI (an AVI without an MJPEG codec is raw
  frames, which fills the 2 GB limit in seconds at 1080p).

### Library, profile & design desk

- The Play dialog holds **RECENT** (the 12 latest songs with note count, track count, tempo, hand split, fall
  speed, playback tempo and preset — reopening restores all of them through the very sliders) and a
  folder-based **LIBRARY** (a bounded BFS of 3 levels/500 files read by the app's own readers, cached by size
  + modification time in `library-index.json`, per-song tags, search over title–file name–tags, and a folder
  watcher so the list follows the disk).
- A **settings profile** `Keyflow.profile.json` gathering the stage settings + language + theme, imported and
  exported on the General page; drag-and-drop of `.json` (a profile), `.mid`/`.midi` (open a song) and images
  (set the background) onto the window.
- **Undo/redo of 32 steps** on the design desk (`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`); one slider drag is one
  step because the snapshot is committed on the auto-save timer's idle tick.
- **Dock search** with per-setting synonyms, token intersection, the setting name as the last safety net, and
  the matched part painted in the accent colour.

### Interface, languages & accessibility

- A dock of **13 pages in 4 groups** (STAGE DESIGN, SOUND & INPUT, SESSION, APP); the page catalogue lives in
  `Ui/SettingsPages.cs` and is compared against the XAML tab strip both statically and at run time.
- **Two languages**: 1,266 string keys, a complete Vietnamese table, switching on an open window with every
  label repainted at once; language/theme/preset ids stay English in the saved files, so switching language
  can never change what is on disk.
- **Accessibility**: `AutomationProperties.Name` on every glyph-only button and every generated row, Tab
  cycling inside the dock in the order the rows are printed, the `SystemColors` palette when Windows turns on
  high contrast, and at 1080×700 every page keeps its controls inside their card even when a word is longer
  in the other language.
- The shortcut card (F1), Escape leaving the topmost layer first, and a start-up menu with the language picker
  and a read-out of the current stage look.

### Packaging & distribution

- **`publish.ps1`**: one command to a single-file **self-contained** (ReadyToRun) or **framework-dependent**
  build for `win-x64` or `win-arm64`, with `-Zip`; the script refuses to publish while
  `Assets\ConcertGrand.sf2` is still a Git LFS pointer, because that build would start without its piano.
- A bilingual **Inno Setup installer** (`installer\Keyflow.iss` plus the 108-message partial translation in
  `installer\Languages\Vietnamese.isl`): it picks the language from Windows, creates Start Menu/Desktop
  shortcuts and an uninstall entry, and `tools/build_installer.ps1` turns any unexpected ISCC warning into an
  error.
- **`release.yml`**: pushing a `v*` tag produces a GitHub Release with **three ZIPs** (self-contained
  `win-x64`, framework-dependent `win-x64`, self-contained `win-arm64`), the **`win-x64` `.exe` installer**
  compiled from that same publish folder, and a **`SHA256SUMS.txt`** of every file so a download can be
  checked by the person who downloaded it (the packages are not code-signed). The published build is smoke
  tested with `--verify` before anything is attached.
- **`LICENSE.txt` (MIT) and `Assets/ATTRIBUTION.txt` (the SoundFont's CC BY 3.0) are inside every package** —
  the ZIPs and the installer's target folder — not only in the repository, which is what both licences ask of
  a copy.
- `build.yml` runs **one real publish** (framework-dependent, `-AllowLfsPointer` because CI does not fetch
  LFS) on every push and checks that the output holds `PianoPath.exe`, `LICENSE.txt` and `Assets\`: a defect
  in the packaging path now turns red at push time instead of waiting for a release to be cut.

### Verification

- **Three verification layers**:
  - `tools/check_sources.py` — static, runs on any machine, needs no .NET SDK. This round added **two
    rules**: `scan_release_version`, which pins the version number to one source (`<Version>` in
    `PianoPath.csproj`), and `scan_project_files`, which parses every MSBuild file (`.csproj`, `.pubxml`)
    the way MSBuild itself would, because an XML comment containing a double hyphen stops the whole
    project from loading.
  - `--verify` — **58 verification functions** on Windows: shader maths, MIDI, SoundFont, AVI/MP4/PNG,
    settings, dock, language, history, profile, accessibility, high contrast, the GPU engine on WARP and
    the perf gate.
  - **README pictures the application renders itself in CI** (one picture per subject per language, plus
    the preset gallery), never staged screenshots.
- **`tests/PianoPath.Tests`**: 133 xUnit test cases on plain `net10.0` (10 linked source files, about a minute
  on Linux) for MIDI, MusicXML, the hand split, the beat grid, WAV, the frame budget and the plain half of
  `Loc`.
- **The `--bench` perf gate**: every frame time measured at 1920×1080 for two scenes (the default settings at
  p95 < 8 ms, the heaviest built-in preset at p95 < 16 ms) on a machine with a real graphics card; on a
  software adapter (every CI runner) it only compares against the previous run and prints `NOTE`, because two
  runs of the same code on WARP have differed by nearly a factor of two.

### Known, and left for after 1.0.0

- **No code signing**: Windows SmartScreen still shows "Windows protected your PC" on first launch (the README
  says how past it). `SHA256SUMS.txt` lets a downloader check a file; it is not a signature.
- **No MSIX, no winget manifest and no in-application update check** — all three need an
  account/certificate or a decision about networking, while the product promises offline and no telemetry
  (`docs/ROADMAP.md` §4 #5).
- **A real MP4 file still waits for an ordinary Windows machine to confirm it**: CI runners hang inside
  `IMFSample::SetSampleTime`, so that check reports `SKIP` there; the application already falls back to AVI
  on a machine like that.
- **The 8/16 ms budget has not been confirmed by a measurement on a real graphics card** — the sandbox and the
  runners only have WARP. The same goes for the `win-arm64` package: CI publishes it, no ARM machine has run
  it yet.
- No *lite* build without the SoundFont yet (~113 MiB is about a third of the total download) —
  `docs/ROADMAP.md` §4 #4.
